## Dotfiles

As i love dracula theme, most of the files contains the config of dracula themes as it is. 
__[Alacritty](https://github.com/Unishkhadka/Dotfiles/tree/main/alacritty)__,  __[Zathura](https://github.com/Unishkhadka/Dotfiles/tree/main/zathura)__ and  __[Polybar](https://github.com/Unishkhadka/Dotfiles/tree/main/polybar)__ are in dracula themes.

Clone:
`git clone https://github.com/Unishkhadka/Dotfiles`

After cloning this you can copy or move your desired folders to .config folder

For Rofi & polybar you can visit __[Aditya Shakya](https://github.com/adi1090x)__ .But after moving the polybar make sure you add `exec --no-startup-id bash ~/.config/polybar/launch.sh --forest ` into your `~/ .config/i3/config`(or what you use)
